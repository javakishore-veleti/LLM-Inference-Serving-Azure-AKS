# Scale the GPU node pool in / out. Use this to stop the GPU bill during a break, or to free
# the GPU while debugging a stuck pod, WITHOUT destroying the cluster.
#
# READ THIS BEFORE USING IT — on AKS, scale-to-zero is usually the WRONG choice:
#
#   scale to 0  ->  ~$0.125/hr  (system node keeps running; cluster survives; ~5-8 min to
#                                first token when you scale back out)
#   destroy     ->  $0.00/hr    (everything gone; ~10-15 min to rebuild from terraform)
#
# The AKS control plane is FREE (sku_tier = "Free"), so unlike a paid-control-plane cluster
# there is very little to preserve by keeping it alive. $0.125/hr is ~$3/day, ~$90/month —
# above the whole project budget. Rule of thumb:
#
#   stepping away < ~4 hrs   -> scale in   (saves $0.684/hr, cluster stays warm)
#   done for the day/longer  -> terraform destroy
#
# WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT TERRAFORM: node_count in aks.tf is 1. Scaling here via the CLI creates
# drift, and the next `terraform apply` will scale the pool straight back to 1. That is
# harmless but surprising — scale back OUT before running terraform, or expect apply to do it
# for you.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/gpu-nodes-scaling.sh status   # what Azure currently thinks
#   scripts/gpu-nodes-scaling.sh in       # count -> 0  (~$0.81/hr -> ~$0.125/hr)
#   scripts/gpu-nodes-scaling.sh out      # count -> 1
